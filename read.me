This is just a little project that I'm doing for recap some things since I wasn't for some time, and I nice start to this Git account since it's showing just the basics off.

Basically a front and back-end for a list, using node and react.
I'm finishing the front-end and I pretend to do a redux version next, and then maybe apply authentication.

To make this work you just need to set up a Postgre database with a "todo" table, with uuid "id", text "description", and boolean "favorite".
I plan to Add some SQL if I develop this project more. Also run "yarn install" or "npm install" in both projects to install the node dependencies
